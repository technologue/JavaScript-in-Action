👨‍🏫 **Developed by Mohamed Seifeddine AZZABI**  
📍 Used in **ISTIC Borj Cédria** and other universities  

A hands-on JavaScript learning course with real-world projects. This repository covers **DOM Manipulation, Fetch API, Web Components, and PWA development**, helping students and developers master modern JavaScript.  

## 📖 About This Course  
This course is designed for students and developers looking to build a **strong JavaScript foundation** through projects and structured learning.  

✅ **DOM Manipulation** – Interacting dynamically with HTML & CSS  
✅ **Fetch API** – Making API requests & handling responses  
✅ **Web Components** – Creating reusable UI elements  
✅ **PWA (Progressive Web Apps)** – Offline-ready & installable apps  

## 🛠 Setting Up Your First Project  
1️⃣ Install **VS Code**  
2️⃣ Create the following files:  
   - `index.html` (Structure)  
   - `./css/style.css` (Design)  
   - `./js/script.js` (Logic)  
3️⃣ Link CSS & JS in `index.html`:  
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
   <script src="./js/script.js" defer></script>
   ```
4️⃣ Organize code into sections:  
   - **Variables Section**  
   - **Functions Section**  
   - **Events Section**
